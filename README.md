# Udacity-Starbucks-Promotion

## Purpose of the project
The purpose of this project is to design a strategy that maximizes IRR and NIR for a promotional campaign by Starbucks. The goal is to identify whom to target with a promotion and how it impacts their likelihood of purchase of starbucks product and how it impacts the campaign's IRR (Incremental Response Rate) and NIR (Net Incremental Revenue). 

## Motivation
When targeting customers with promotions, an AB test is often expensive and may take too long to conclude. With historical promotion data and past AB test data, it is possible to construct a predictive model for who is more likely to respond to a promotional campaign and thereby better target them. We can limit our promotional offers to who is most likely to be responsive and avoid targeting customers who would have bought our products anyway regardless of promotions and avoid targeting customers who are likely to be annoyed by unsolicited promotional offers, making them LESS likely to purchase our product.
